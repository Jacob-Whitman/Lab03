 * The Player class holds the number of the player, whether or not it's the player's
 * turn, and a TomJerryUnit controlled by the player. It can also set and get each
 * parameter, as well as creating three types of Player units: one with no parameters,
 * one with a player number and TomJerryUnit as parameters, and one with all 3 as parameters.
